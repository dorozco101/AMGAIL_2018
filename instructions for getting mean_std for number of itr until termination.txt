Getting mean/std itr until termination for each environment, comparing amgail and mgail


First, get mixed. then bad. then good. For easiest to hardest environment

change env and skill in main
term_condition is per environment
test_interval controls "resolution". every test_interval, avg reward is computed.

once avg reward > = term condition, loop breaks and a figure is generated. Num iterations in in the title. Record the number in the chart. Num iterations is also printed in terminal


save_fig doesn't work right now

if using spyder, restart kernel in between runs
